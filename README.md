# Pipeline Emotion Detection

This project focuses on building a robust pipeline for detecting human emotions from textual data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Understanding emotions in text is essential for applications like sentiment analysis, customer feedback interpretation, and enhancing human-computer interaction. This project implements a structured data processing and machine learning pipeline to classify text into various emotional categories.

## Features

- **Data Processing Pipeline:** Structured data flow with clear directories for raw, interim, and processed data.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to train a classifier for text-based emotion detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Comprehensive metrics to assess model accuracy and performance.
- **Modular and Scalable Codebase:** Well-organized source code for data preparation, feature engineering, and model training.
